### app/plugins/commands/__init__.py
This code defines a series of command classes for basic arithmetic operations, adhering to the Command design pattern. Each class inherits from a base Command class (presumably defined elsewhere) and implements an execute method to perform the corresponding operation.
### 1)	AddCommand:
- Executes addition of provided arguments.
- Logs the operation with logging.info.
- Returns the sum of the arguments using Python's sum() function.
### 2)	SubtractCommand:
- Executes subtraction of provided arguments.
- Initializes result with the first argument and iteratively subtracts each subsequent argument.
- Returns the final result after all subtractions.
### 3)	MultiplyCommand:
- Executes multiplication of provided arguments.
- Initializes result to 1 and iteratively multiplies each argument.
- Returns the final product after all multiplications.
### 4)	DivideCommand:
- Executes division of provided arguments.
- Initializes result with the first argument and iteratively divides by each subsequent argument.
- Returns the final quotient after all divisions.
