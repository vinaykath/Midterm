### app/plugins/history_manager.py:
I provided code defines a HistoryManager class that implements the Singleton pattern, ensuring only one instance of the class exists. This is achieved by overriding the __new__ method to check if an instance already exists, and if not, create one.
The class is designed to manage a history of commands, their arguments, and results, storing this data in a CSV file. During initialization, it attempts to load history from a specified file (data/history.csv). If the file doesn't exist, it creates an empty DataFrame with columns: 'command', 'args', and 'result'.
### Key methods include:
- load_history(): Loads command history from the CSV file. If the file is missing, it returns an empty DataFrame.
- save_history(): Saves the current state of the history DataFrame to the CSV file.
- add_record(command, args, result): Adds a new record of a command, its arguments, and result to the history DataFrame, and then saves the updated history.
- clear_history(): Clears all history records by resetting the DataFrame and saving the empty state to the file.
'''

The use of hasattr in __init__ ensures initialization logic runs only once, even if the Singleton instance is created multiple times. This class effectively manages persistent command history, making it useful for tracking and debugging command executions.
