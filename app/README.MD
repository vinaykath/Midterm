### app/__init__.py:
The code of app/__init__.py defines a Python application that loads environment variables, configures logging, and processes user commands using plugins. Here's a concise explanation of the key components and their functionality:
1. Imports and Initialization:
- Necessary modules and classes are imported and the App class is defined, with its constructor initializing logging, loading environment variables, and setting default settings.
2.	Logging Configuration:
-	The configure_logging method sets up logging. If a logging.conf file exists, it's used; otherwise, basic logging is configured.
3)	Environment Variables:
-	The load_environment_variables method loads all environment variables into a dictionary named settings, logging this process.
-	The get_environment_variable method retrieves a specific environment variable's value.
4.	Plugin Loading:
-	The load_plugins method loads plugins from the app.plugins directory. It iterates through the plugins, importing each one and registering its commands.
-	The register_plugin_commands method registers commands from each plugin with the CommandProcessor.
5.	Application Start:
-	The start method begins the application's main loop. It initializes a CommandProcessor and a HistoryManager.
-	It logs the environment (defaulting to "development" if not set) and prints available commands to the user.
-	The main loop processes user inputs. Depending on the command, it may:
- -	Display the menu or history,
- -	Clear the history,
- - Execute a command (e.g., add, subtract, multiply, divide) by passing the command and arguments to the CommandProcessor.
- If the command execution is successful, it logs the result and adds the command to the history. If errors occur, it handles and logs them accordingly.
